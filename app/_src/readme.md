Grunt handles all CoffeeScript configuration. You can configure compiler 
settings in the project's Gruntfile.js.

There may be boilerplate javascript files in `app/js`. Move or delete 
them to avoid collision.

For detailed information on configuring CoffeeScript with Grunt, see the docs 
at https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-coffee.
